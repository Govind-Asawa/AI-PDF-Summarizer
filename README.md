<b>Welcome to our AI-powered research paper summarization tool!
</b>
<p>
  
This tool is designed to help you quickly and accurately summarize research papers. With just a few clicks, you can obtain a concise and informative summary of any research paper, saving you time and effort.

Getting started is easy. Simply upload the research paper you wish to summarize, and our AI algorithm will analyze and extract the most important information from the paper. Our algorithm uses advanced natural language processing techniques to identify the key concepts, ideas, and findings presented in the paper, and condenses them into a succinct and coherent summary.

Our tool is designed to work with research papers from a variety of fields and disciplines, including but not limited to science, engineering, medicine, social sciences, and humanities. Whether you need to quickly understand the main findings of a paper for your own research or to communicate the highlights of a paper to your colleagues, our tool can help.

Please note that while our tool is `highly accurate` and `reliable`, it is not intended to replace the need for reading and understanding the full paper(only able to summarize it). Our summarization is meant to provide a quick overview of the main ideas and findings presented in the paper, and should be used as a supplement to your own reading and analysis.

To run this AI application, git clone the repository to your machine and install the requirement package.
```
git clone https://github.com/pham0084/finalfantasyxv/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
After succesfully install the required packages, run `streamlit run AIRST.py` in your terminal then everything should be working just fine!

  We hope you have fun!
